/**
 \page other Other Kaldi-related resources (and how to get help)

 The main places where Kaldi knowledge can be found are this website,
 and in the subversion repository (see \ref install for instructions).
 The repository contains the Kaldi code; the installation scripts;
 and example scripts for a number of different datasets, which are located
 in the sub-directory egs/).  

 Kaldi's <a href=http://sourceforge.net/projects/kaldi/>project page on Sourceforge</a> also contains
 a number of useful resources.

 The <a href=https://sourceforge.net/projects/kaldi/forums> Kaldi forums on Sourceforge </a> are
 a good place to ask questions.  Most user questions go to the "Help" forum.  If you want to receive
 all the traffic, you have to be logged in to Sourceforge; you can subscribe to the forum by clicking
 on the "Help" forum and then clicking the envelope icon towards the top right.  There are also
 "Open Discussion" and "Developers" forums, which get less traffic.

 There is a mailing list <a
 href=mailto:kaldi-developers@lists.sourceforge.net>kaldi-developers@lists.sourceforge.net</a>
 (<a href=https://sourceforge.net/p/kaldi/mailman/>archives here</a>), which you
 may subscribe to <a
 href=https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/kaldi-developers>here</a>.
 This gets only a moderate amount of traffic, and the aim is for any important
 developments to be communicated to that list.  Clueless questions to that list
 are discouraged.  There is also a kaldi-users list there, which gets less
 traffic and is deprecated.  Note: if you email these lists and your email address is not
 subscribed to that list, it goes to the moderators so there will be a delay
 before your message appears.

 The site <a href="http://kaldi-asr.org"> kaldi-asr.org </a> was created in August 2014 to host the Kaldi model-build
 directories that were built with the example scripts.  This will be useful as a reference for
 debugging and for those who want access to the built models.  With time it will contain an increasingly
 large fraction of the outputs of the example scripts in the repository.

 This <a href=http://www.danielpovey.com/jobs.html> job postings page </a> is not directly Kaldi-related
 but may be useful to many of the same people.
