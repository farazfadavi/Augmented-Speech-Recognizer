This is the official Idlak readme. Note that this is supposed to be a mirror
of a relatively recent kaldi repository, with various tools and examples added.

Idlak is a project to build an end-to-end parametric TTS
system within Kaldi, to be distributed with the same licence.

It contains a robust front-end, voice building tools, speech analysis
utilities, and DNN tools suitable for parametric synthesis. It also contains
an example of using Idlak as an end-to-end TTS system, in egs/tts_dnn_arctic/s1

Note that the kaldi structure has been maintained and the tool building
procedure is identical.

Read Kaldi.md and INSTALL.md first!

The documentation should be build separately, cf. src/doc/README.

Normally this documentation
is generated by running "doxygen" from the src/ directory,
and appears in src/html/

I assume that the reader would like to (1) build the toolkit
and (2) run the example system builds.

To build the toolkit: see ./INSTALL.  These instructions are valid for UNIX
systems including various flavors of Linux; Darwin; and Cygwin (has not been
tested on more "exotic" varieties of UNIX).  For Windows installation
instructions (excluding Cygwin), see windows/INSTALL.

To run the example system builds, see egs/README.txt

If you are reading this, you probably want to build the "Tangle" demo, which
is located egs/tts_dnn_arctic/s1.

If you encounter problems (and you probably will), please do not hesitate
to contact the developers at
 https://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=kaldi-developers
In addition to specific questions, please let us know if there are specific
aspects of the project that you feel could be improved, that you find confusing,
etc., and which missing features you most wish it had.
